    <h1> HARRY POTTER UNKNOWN THEORIES </h1>
    <hr>

    <h3 id="theoryname"> The Ron-Bledore Theory </h3>
    <br>
    <p id="theory"> This theory states that Ron lived his “first life” as the book suggests: He goes to Hogwarts with Harry and Hermione, and ends up marrying her. However, at some point later in his life, he’s sent back in time to live a “second life” as Albus Dumbledore. This way, he would be able to become Harry’s mentor once all the problems and adventures from the series started. <br> Here are the arguments:
        They look alike, in fact, Ron is and Dumbledore was, red-headed, both have long noses, and the 2 are tall and thin. <br>
        Dumbledore once said he had a scar above his left knee in the shape of the London Underground, and we also know that Ron injured his knee in The Prisoner of Azkaban.
        <br>
        Dumbledore confessed that when he was young he started to dislike Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans after eating a vomit flavored one. But there’s a timeline problem here: Dumbledore is around 150, because wizards live way longer than muggles, but Bertie Bott was founded in 1935. He would have had to have been born after 1935 and not in the middle of the 1800s, as he appears, to have tried a vomit flavored bean in his youth.
        Dumbledore seems to know everything. Sometimes he’s somehow aware of Harry’s, Ron’s, and Hermione’s secret plans. <br>
        He and Ron rarely meet face to face in the series. In fact, when Scrimgeour reveals Dumbledore’s will, Ron is remarkably puzzled that he got the Deluminator. Dumbledore has long fingers, Ron’s large hands and a love of sweets (“When we first meet Dumbledore he offers a lemon sherbet to Professor McGonagall. When we first meet Ron he introduces Harry to the wonderful world of wizarding candy”). The fan also thinks Latin meaning (a running theme in the book) of the word ‘bin’ is significant: “In OotP, Draco composes a lovely song — Weasley is Our King. If that isn’t foreshadowing, I don’t know what is. One line in particular is given significance by Draco. He is heard singing it loudly during the game by Harry, and Draco later quotes it in italics — born in a bin. While Draco likes to make fun of Ron’s poverty, the phrase has a double meaning. ‘Bin’ is also a prefix meaning ‘double’ or ‘two’ — think ‘binary.’ Was Ron ‘born’ twice? Leading a double life? Is Draco trying to tell us something important?”

    <h3> Crookshanks Was Lily Potters Cat </h3>
    <br>
    <p> When the 3 friends are in Grimmauld Place, Harry finds a letter written by Lily, his mom. There she mentions that the Potter family owned a cat and that baby Harry almost stepped on it while he was playing with his toy broomstick. No one knows if the kitty came out alive after Voldemort’s attack, but many are sure that Crookshanks is that same cat. Here’s proof:Hermione purchases Crookshanks in The Prisoner of Azkaban, at a place in Diagon Alley called Magical Menagerie. The store owner says that he has had the kitten for “quite some time” because no one wanted him. According to our timeline, from the attack to the day Hermione bought the cat, 12 years had passed, and that definitely qualifies as “quite some time.” <br>
        Crookshanks feels at ease with Sirius as a dog and Sirius as a human. That must be because he used to visit James and Lily before the attack and was friendly with them. Crookshanks recognizes Scabbers and despises him immediately. Peter Pettigrew was also an old friend of James and Lily, but he was the one who betrayed them. The cat may not know what betrayal is, but he sure recognized him as being next to Voldemort the night of the attack and saw him turn into a rat after his owners lost their lives. </p>

    <H3> We Knew About Dumbledore’s Death Since The Third Book: Professor Trelawney Predicted It. </H3>
    <br>
    <P>In 'The Prisoner of Azkaban', Professor Trelawney is hesitant about sitting down to enjoy a Christmas dinner with other students and professors because she saw 12 people seated at the table. She explained that when 13 people dine together, the first person to rise will be the first of them to die.
        But there were already 13 people dining at the table. No one noticed Peter Pettigrew disguised as Scabbers the rat, hiding inside of Ron’s pocket. Albus Dumbledore was the first of them to rise to welcome Professor Trelawney, and he was the first of the party to die. </P>

    <h3>"All Was Not Well" (aka Harry Hallucinated Everything)</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Some conspiracy theorists have posited that Harry, who is deprived of food by his aunt and uncle in the first book, hallucinated the entire story as he was starving in the cupboard under the stairs. This might seem like the Dementor of all theories — because it sucks all light and happiness out of the series — but J.K. Rowling addressed these ideas herself in a 2012 video that accompanied a box set of the movies. Steve Kloves, a screenwriter for the film series, said he invented a spider who Harry would talk to in the cupboard. “The point was that he seemed slightly mad…so when Hagrid appeared, you thought he was out of his imagination for a minute,” Kloves says on the video. “I think that’s a fabulous point and that speaks so perfectly to the books,” Rowling responds. “Because I’ve heard it suggested to me more than once, that Harry actually did go mad in the cupboard and that everything that happened subsequently was some sort of fantasy life he developed to save himself.”</p>

    <h3> Draco Malfoy Is a Werewolf (And Not a Death Eater) </h3>
    <br>
    <p>There is actually a website dedicated to this theory. Dracamalfoyisawerewolf.com. So there’s that. The evidence the theorists have stem from Malfoy’s character development in the later books. “Between the fifth and sixth books, directly after Lucius Malfoy has failed to retrieve the prophecy, Voldemort allows Fenrir Greyback to bite his son, Draco.” They also point out that he’s not a Death Eater, which we already knew. And “Voldemort says, “Maybe you can babysit the cubs,” to Draco when the Death Eaters find out that Remus and Tonks are having a baby. This is a throwaway if he is not a werewolf.
        Malfoy and Snape are close because Malfoy is getting Wolfsbane potion from Snape and that, maybe, Rowling will reveal this on Pottermore.

    <h3> Voldemort Created More Horcruxes Than We Knew Of </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        One of the unanswered questions of the Harry Potter series involves the process behind creating a Horcrux. All we know so far is that it requires the loss of a human life and an object to contain a piece of the soul that had been sundered, but J. K. Rowling has made it clear that there is more involved when a Horcrux is made. The mystery behind the method of creating a Horcrux led many fans to speculate that Voldemort had created more Horcruxes than Dumbledore ever realized.
        Pottermore finally proved that this theory was real when it revealed that Professor Quirrell was a temporary Horcrux and that Voldemort's presence in his body was corrupting him from the inside out. It's possible that Voldemort may have created many similar temporary Horcruxes during his exile.

    <h3>Ariana Dumbledore Was An Obscurial </h3>
    <br>

    <p> Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows revealed that Albus Dumbledore had a younger sister named Ariana. The details of Ariana's life are murky - all we know is that she was mentally scarred following an incident with some Muggle children and that she wasn't able to control her magical abilities.
        The Fantastic Beasts movie revealed the existence of Obscurials, which are witches and wizards that contain a parasitic magical force inside of them that is brought out when they are forced to repress their abilities. We still don't know the truth behind Ariana Dumbledore, but there are a lot of connections between her and the Obscurials, which has led many fans to believe that she was one. Gellert Grindelwald may have also discovered the power of an Obscurial in Ariana during his time spent with the Dumbledore family, which is why he is hunting for them in the movies.

    <h3>Barty Crouch Jr, Bill Weasley, And Percy Weasley Used Time-Turners During Their Time At Hogwarts </h3>
    <br>
    <p>It was stated in Prisoner of Azkaban that it was impossible to take all twelve O.W.L. classes, due to how the timetables worked. It was only due to the fact that Hermione was an amazing student that she was able to use a Time-Turner to try and take them all.
        It has been stated that Barty Crouch Jr, Bill Weasley, and Percy Weasley acquired twelve O.W.L.s during their time at Hogwarts. This had led fans to believe that it was more common for exemplary students to receive Time-Turners than we were led to believe. It's likely that there is an official process for granting a Time-Turner to a student, but the teachers only ever discuss it with the rare students who can handle the workload. It makes sense that they don't want it to become common knowledge that amazing students can be given free time machines, in order to prevent any potential abuse of the power.

    <h3> Harry And Ginny’s Son Was Not Named Remus </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Fans have had a field day with Harry and Ginny’s, er, unusual naming system for their children, which honored a number of late and living loved ones, but seemed to be conspicuously absent one name. With James Sirius representing two of the three Marauders who didn’t turn out to be cowardly traitors, it would naturally fall to the Potters’ second son to carry on the legacy of the man who taught Harry how to defend himself against Dementors and gave his life to help defeat the Death Eaters. The fact that the middle Potter child was named Albus Severus after Dumbledore and Snape rather than Lupin outraged a number of fans, who were quick to point out that Remus is a lovely name, and certainly one less fraught with baggage than that of the former Potions Master. An optimistic few, however, rushed to find an explanation: Perhaps the Potters hadn’t skipped over Remus Lupin, but saved his memory for someone else. Rowling affirmed this act of kindness over Twitter, saying that “Harry left Remus’s name for Teddy to use for his own son”—not a snub, but a gift.</p> <br>

    <h3>Dumbledore Saw His Family In The Mirror Of Erised </h3> <br>

    <p>The Mirror of Erised has provided us with some of the most epic and legendary quotes in the entire Harry Potter series, and those quotes all belong to one man, Albus Dumbledore. It was Dumbledore who stated, "Men have wasted away before it, not knowing if what they have seen is real, or even possible.
        Dumbledore speaks from personal experience as he has seen his family restored to him, Ariana, Kendra and Percival standing next to him, and Aberforth reconciled. </p><br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Voldemort's Boggart Would Be His Corpse</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        This is an extremely dark entry, even for someone as malicious as Voldemort. Voldemort apparently fears nothing, he murders without hesitation, he betrays without caution, and he refuses to get close to anyone. But according to J.K. Rowling, there is one thing that Voldemort fears, and it’s the thing we all fear, death. <br>
        When asked about his boggart, J.K. stated, “Voldemort’s fear is death, ignominious death. I mean, he regards death itself as ignominious. He thinks that it’s a shameful human weakness, as you know. His worst fear is death, but how would a boggart show that? I’m not too sure. I did think about that because I knew you were going to ask me that.” <br>
        This does make sense, what with Voldemort’s extreme steps to break apart his soul into several pieces.

    <h3> Harry, Snape, and Voldemort Were The Descendants of The Three Brothers </h3>
    <br>
    <p>The theory that Harry, Snape, and Voldemort are the modern representation of the siblings from The Tales of the Three Brothers is intriguing, and seems to be pretty well accepted by the Harry Potter fandom. It is known that Harry is a descendant of Ignotus Peverell, and Voldemort is descended from Cadmus Peverell. So it’s not too far-fetched to think that Snape could also be a descendant of one of the brothers.
        Taking into consideration the fact that Voldemort died for power, Snape died for lost love, and Harry greeted death like an old friend gives the theory the extra weight it needs to gain legitimacy. There are many fans who argue the theory's claims, and others who are convinced that perhaps Dumbledore is a part of the modern three brothers (but there will be more on that later).
        Like the three brothers of old, Harry, Snape, and Voldemort each chose vastly different paths in life, but were all eventually either taken, or welcomed by death.</p> <br>
    <hr>
    <h3>Dumbledore Is Death </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Dumbledore being the personification of Death was foreshadowed earlier when talking about the modern-day Tale of the Three Brothers, using Harry, Voldemort, and Snape. This theory also originated on Tumblr, and it took the Potter community by storm when it was first thought up.
        Here’s all the evidence supporting this theory. First of all, Dumbledore, like Death, is the one to give the Invisibility Cloak to Harry in the first book. Dumbledore is also the one to give the Resurrection Stone to Harry by hiding it in the Golden Snitch. Dumbledore also indirectly delivers the Elder Wand to Harry when Harry defeats Draco Malfoy in a duel. The final evidence that Dumbledore is Death is that he is either behind/involved in both the death of Snape and Voldemort.
        The only ancillary evidence that would give this theory more credence would be if Snape and Voldemort greeted Dumbledore at the end of their lives. This seems to make the most sense in the context of the Three Brothers theory.
